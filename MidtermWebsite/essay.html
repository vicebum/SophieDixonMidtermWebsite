  <p class="essay">Mindfulness and mediation have been associated with several aspects of culture throughout the world and are deeply tied to Buddhism. The religion originated in India and spread predominantly to south-eastern Asian countries. Zen Buddhism is most commonly attributed to Japan and involves some of the simplest teachings of meditative practice. Mindfulness is a broad term used to describe a state of being, where a person is attentive to their experience in a present moment. Mediation is a more structured practice of disciplined and engaged awareness, but the two follow many of the same guideline. Mindfulness and meditation are core to spiritual applications, but have also expanded to include various secular activities in daily life. These can be proposed using three main pillars of understanding; equilibrium, awareness, and the body itself. Each of these ideas can be contextualized in its own respected histories. For the purpose of addressing a beginner’s orientation, meditative practice can be made accessible and customizable, so long as there is acknowledgment of these core postulations.
  </p>
  <p class="essay">The definition of equilibrium is essentially to maintain balance between multiple forces. The Thai Buddhist Monk speaks on the concept, “Do everything with a mind that lets go. If you let go a little you will have a little peace. If you let go a lot you will have a lot of peace”. Although this sounds exacting, it’s merely a prompt to better appreciate the ability to control our attachment to the way that things are. By “letting go” one is not neglecting their cravings and suffering - or just regular thoughts - but instead paying attention to the entirety of what is happening, in big ways and small. The purpose of understanding equilibrium is to set up a home base for mindfulness or meditation practice. This way a person who wants to partake in this kind of practice can have a sense of security that they can use to direct whatever might happen in the next moment. A popular manifestation of this idea is to focus, or redirect one's attention back to their breath. Even this might be challenging for some, so that’s why we can recognize the other two mainstays in meditative practice.
  </p>
  <p class="essay">Awareness is a very broad term, but is necessary to position the practice. When a person sits down to meditate, a lot can start to happen to their perception. With the factors of stillness, posture, and the person’s intention, all of the sudden they can hear the hum of the fridge or the sharp pain in their lower back, to illustrate some examples. Even though they may not have noticed these sensations before sitting down, much of their subconscious experience can now be made conscious. In personal experience with awareness, there have been several moments where paying attention to the physical sensations in the body have helped me to realize the feelings of anxiety or sadness which I may have been experiencing. For instance, by paying attention to a sensation of heaviness in the chest, I can claim the agency to change the situation I am in by talking with a loved one about what I’m feeling. Therefore, this act of awareness becomes one of the larger benefits to human health and wellbeing.
  </p>
  <p class="essay">A third element to acknowledge is the physical participation of the body. In tandem with the groundwork of intentional balance, the body itself should be positioned in a way which is intentional. The conventional form of mediation has been the seated cross legged poison. Zen practitioners tend to keep their eyes open, with blurred gaze, at the floor in front. This however can be too uncomfortably distracting for some, and lying down, or even doing an activity, could better serve the individual. Part of what makes meditative practices inaccessible is that there is a notion that the posture must be very structured in alignment, which often feels restrictive or even painful. Although there is value for this typical assembly of the body, mediation can also take place when running, walking, cleaning, cycling, and more. What’s most important is that the posture, or movement, of the body must allow for an awareness of both exterior and interior depth of perception. This might simply mean not attempting to multitask, or paying attention to the details of the present point in time. It is also crucial to approach the practice without judgment of the self. It is incredibly easy to become angry and frustrated when we cannot focus or get lost in thoughts. When this happens, a meditator should know that the best thing to do is to gently correct the mind’s attention and return to something grounded in the present, like the breath.
  </p>
  <p class="essay">There is a plethora of topics just surrounding the breath alone, but these basic principals are the key for all beginner practitioners to recognize. This website will cover these topics as educational tools to guide a user-friendly introduction to mindfulness and meditation.
